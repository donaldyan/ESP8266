# Low Power Voltage Measurement

This is a project for ESP8266 for low power sensor applications. 
The chip powers on once every 1 minute, and sends the data to the 
server, once every 20 minutes. 

The project is based on Espressif's SDK version 0.9.5. More details
about the project can be found in the Wiki.
